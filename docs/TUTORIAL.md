## What is `pypi-toolkit`?

`pypi-toolkit` is a command-line utility designed to automate the process of building, testing, and uploading Python packages to PyPI. It simplifies the standard Python packaging workflow by allowing developers to perform these steps in a single or combined command, improving efficiency and reducing errors.

### Features:
- **Build**: Creates a source distribution and wheel for your Python package.
- **Test**: Runs unit tests using `pytest`.
- **Upload**: Uploads your package to PyPI (or TestPyPI).
- **All**: Runs all the above actions in sequence.

---

## Installation

You can install `pypi-toolkit` either locally (for development purposes) or directly from PyPI once it's published.

### Install Locally
If you want to install it for local development:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This allows you to modify the code and instantly see the changes.

### Install from PyPI
Once the package is uploaded to PyPI, install it using:

```bash
pip install pypi-toolkit
```

---

## Basic Usage

After installing, you can use `pypi-toolkit` via the command line to handle your Python package lifecycle.

### Example Command:
```bash
pypi-toolkit <action>
```

Where `<action>` can be one of the following:
- `build`: Build the package.
- `test`: Run the tests using `pytest`.
- `upload`: Upload the package to PyPI.
- `all`: Perform all three actions in sequence (build, test, upload).

---

## Detailed Commands

### Build

Builds your Python package into source distributions and wheels, making it ready for distribution.

```bash
pypi-toolkit build
```

This command will run the following under the hood:

```bash
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

The output is stored in the `dist/` folder, which contains the `.tar.gz` and `.whl` files necessary for distribution.

### Test

Runs unit tests using `pytest`. Ensure that your `tests/` directory is set up correctly before running this command.

```bash
pypi-toolkit test
```

This command will automatically run:

```bash
pytest
```

### Upload

Uploads the built distribution files to PyPI. It will also check if `twine` is installed, and install it if necessary.

```bash
pypi-toolkit upload
```

This command performs:

```bash
twine upload dist/*
```

To upload to TestPyPI (for testing purposes), use the following command instead:

```bash
pypi-toolkit upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
```

### All

Runs the entire pipeline: build, test, and upload in one go. This is useful for automating the full release process.

```bash
pypi-toolkit all
```

This command will sequentially:
- Build the package
- Run the tests
- Upload the package to PyPI

## Using `pypi-toolkit` with Cookiecutter

You can further accelerate your development workflow by combining `pypi-toolkit` with `cookiecutter`, a tool that helps generate project templates.

### What is Cookiecutter?

`cookiecutter` is a command-line utility that creates projects from templates. These templates can include everything you need for a basic Python package, including `setup.py`, `README.md`, and necessary directory structures.

### Installation

If you donâ€™t have `cookiecutter` installed yet, you can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

### Step 1: Choose a Python Package Template

You can use any `cookiecutter` Python package template. For instance, the popular `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage` template can be used to scaffold a Python package:

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage
```

This will guide you through a series of prompts to set up your Python package project, generating files like `setup.py`, `tests/`, `README.md`, and others for you.

### Step 2: Integrate `pypi-toolkit`

Once your Python package is scaffolded by `cookiecutter`, you can directly start using `pypi-toolkit` to manage the build/test/upload lifecycle.

For example, after generating the package:

1. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd my_package_name
   ```

2. Install the dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start using `pypi-toolkit` for your package development:
   - Build the package:
     ```bash
     pypi-toolkit build
     ```
   - Test the package:
     ```bash
     pypi-toolkit test
     ```
   - Upload to PyPI:
     ```bash
     pypi-toolkit upload
     ```

### Automating the Workflow

To streamline the process even further, you can create a Makefile or bash script to automate the `cookiecutter` setup and `pypi-toolkit` commands in a single command.

Example Makefile:

```makefile
setup:
	cookiecutter https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage #We'll be releasing a template generator pretty soon, keep posted!

build:
	pypi-toolkit build

test:
	pypi-toolkit test

upload:
	pypi-toolkit upload
```

With this setup, you could scaffold a new package, build it, test it, and upload it with just a few commands.
